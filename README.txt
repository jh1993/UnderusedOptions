PLEASE CHECK THE DISCORD THREAD FOR UPDATE NOTICES, AND RE-DOWNLOAD THE MOD WHENEVER THERE'S AN UPDATE.

This mod requires my Bugs and Scams mod: https://github.com/jh1993/BugsAndScams

To install this mod, click on the green "Code" button on this page, then "Download ZIP". Please rename the "UnderusedOptions-main" folder to "UnderusedOptions" before putting it into your mods folder.

This mod makes changes to a number of spells and skills that I believe to be underwhelming or not interesting enough compared to other options. A secondary goal is to add new upgrades to certain spells that are severely lacking in meaningful, interesting upgrades.

Changelog:

Death Bolt:
- Damage upgrade cost reduced to 1 SP. This should make it more attractive as a quick power boost in early game, and useful for Cantrip Cascade builds.
- Withering upgrade now makes it also deal physical damage to non-living targets, but SP cost increased to 5.

Fireball:
- Damage type upgrades changed to redeal all fire damage resisted or blocked by SH as a split between the other damage types.

Poison Sting:
- Torment (5 SP): Deal 1 extra damage per 10 turns of poison on the target, and 1 extra damage per turn of every other debuff on the target. Deal 1 extra damage per debuff on the target. Multiple stacks of the same type of debuff are counted as different debuffs.

Wolf:
- Ice hounds are now nature units.
- Wolf Pack cost reduced to 7, because I don't think anything should cost more than 7 SP; 7 SP should be enough for this upgrade anyways. It also counts as casting the spell twice, to make you not lose out on Thorn Garden and Icy Spriggan shrine procs. Number of wolves summoned now benefits from num summons bonuses.

Annihilate:
- Max charges upgrade now costs 6 SP and gives +16 charges.
- Arcane Annihilation and Dark Annihilation merged into one upgrade that costs 2 SP, so you can save SP at a circle.
- Disintegrate (7 SP): Annihilate will now deal all of its damage in separate 1 damage hits, cycling through all of its damage types repeatedly. Each hit removes SH separately, and cannot be resisted unless the target is immune to that damage type.

Blazerip:
- Fractal Rip (6 SP): Each hit of Blazerip now has a 10% chance of triggering another Blazerip on that tile. This can still happen even if an empty tile is hit. Each rip can trigger at most one additional rip.

Boiling Blood:
- Retroactive (4 SP): You now gain Bloodlust Aura when you cast this spell, during which all minions you summon will automatically gain Boiling Blood for the remaining duration.

Disperse:
- Quantum Shadow (6 SP): Summon a void ghost in the former location of each unit teleported away. These void ghosts cannot be affected by this spell.

Eye of Fire:
- Eye of Blasting (3 SP): On hit, Eye of Fire also deals damage to all enemies adjacent to the target.

Eye of Ice:
- Eye of Freezing (3 SP): On hit, the target is frozen for 1 turn.

Eye of Lightning:
- Eye of Arcing (3 SP): On hit, Eye of Lightning also deals damage to a random enemy in line of sight of the target.

Eye of Rage:
- Lycanthropy upgrade reduced to 4 SP and changed to also work on nature and demon units, no longer berserk the werewolf, and no longer trigger on-death effects.

Fan of Flames:
- Previously, if you're somehow moved into the target square while channeling, you'll hit all tiles in range except yourself. Now, if this happens, you'll only hit all tiles in a radius of 5 plus bonuses, but there's now a Wheel of Flames upgrade (4 SP) that lets you simply target yourself with the spell to reproduce the effect.

Freeze:
- Absolute Zero (6 SP): The target now permanently loses 100 ice resistance before being frozen.
- Permafrost (5 SP): When targeting an already frozen unit, increase the duration of freeze on it by one third of this spell's duration if the result is greater than this spell's duration. Then deal ice damage equal to twice the target's freeze duration.

Healing Light:
- Cleansing Light (3 SP): Healing Light will now remove all debuffs from affected allies before healing them.
- Now considers berserked allies as friendly, due to the above.

Heavenly Blast:
- Spirit Bind cost reduced to 4 SP, and now inflicts a Spirit Binding debuff that raises the target as a spirit on death, which is removed at the beginning of your next turn.
- Echo Heal now benefits from duration bonuses.

Hollow Flesh:
- As per my No More Scams mod, no longer limited to living units.
- Mockery of Life (2 SP): Affected units no longer gain dark resistance.
- Vigor Mortis (4 SP): When your minions are affected, their max HP are instead buffed by the same percentage. They do not gain heal immunity, and instead gain 100 poison resistance. If you have the Fire Vulnerability upgrade, they instead gain 50 ice resistance. If you have the Mockery of Life upgrade, they still gain dark resistance and do not lose holy resistance.

Hungry Maw:
- Range upgrade folded into base spell (from 7 to 11).
- Maw now has a melee bite attack that deals 3x damage.
- Pull Strength (3 SP): +2 tiles pulled.
- Shield Eater (3 SP): The maw gains 1 SH on kill and when attacking a shielded target, up to its original SH amount.

Invoke Savagery:

- Blood Savagery (3 SP): Now also affects nature and demon units.
- Stampede (5 SP): If no melee targets are available, each ally will instead try to perform a charge attack with a range of 6 tiles. This attack benefits from bonuses to minion range, and does not stun.

Magnetize:

- Universal Magnetism upgrade reduced to 3 SP.

Melt:
- As per my No More Scams mod, debuffs are now permanent.

Petrify:
- Stone Curse (6 SP): Whenever an enemy is inflicted with petrify or glassify, inflict Stone Curse to it, which reduces holy, dark, arcane, and poison resistances by 50. This has a 50% chance to consume a charge from Petrify, and Stone Curse will not be inflicted if it tries but fails to consume a charge.

Soul Swap:
- Shadow Swap (2 SP): Soul Swap can target dark units as well.
- Infernal Swap (3 SP): Soul Swap can target demon units as well.

- All the damage type upgrades now do the same amount of damage as dark damage done, but are increased to 2 SP. Now also has a lightning damage upgrade.
- Damage (4 SP): +200 damage.
- Touch of the Raven and Touch of the Vampire removed. Touch of the Reaper now has the reapers use your Touch of Death as well, and it's no longer limited to living units.

Toxic Spores:
- Red mushboom self-destruct now benefit from minion damage bonuses. All other mushbooms now benefit from duration bonuses.
- Grey Mushbooms upgrade replaced by Toxic Mushbooms (4 SP), which is mutually exclusive with other mushboom type upgrades and gives 3-radiu 1-damage poison auras to mushbooms. Stunning is redundant with Paralyzing Venom anyways, not to mention losing poison synergy.

- Max Charges upgrade removed.
- Dark Horizon (3 SP): Hostile demon and undead units have a 5% chance to be blinded per tile away from you.

Damage dealt by spells inherited from the caster of this spell, and damage done by spells inherited from the unit that this spell is inherited from, cannot be echoed, in cases of minions inheriting or copying your spells.

Devour Mind:
- All of the HP threshold effects are now calculated after redeals, to make the spell more forgiving.

Earthquake:
- Description changed to clarify that it also turns chasms into floor tiles.
- Added a 3 SP +25% strikechance upgrade.

Flame Burst:
- Bright Flame upgrade replaced by Phoenix Flame, which costs 4 SP and heals allies (except the wizard) instead of damaging them, and does not change the damage type. This makes it a natural extension of the base spell while providing additional healing with Pyrophilia, instead of changing the damage type to holy and losing out on all fire synergies.

Frostfire Hydra:
- Beams now benefit from both minion damage and breath damage bonuses.
- Is now a permanent minion; minion duration upgrade removed. Try not to box yourself in and softlock yourself.
- Dragon Mage (6 SP): The hydra will cast Melt on the target of its fire beam, and Freeze on the target of its ice beam. These spells gains all of your upgrades and bonuses.

Giant Bear:
- Max Charges upgrade removed and its benefits folded into the base spell.

For every 100 ice resistance the polar bear has above 100, the self-healing and ice aura activate once per turn. An excess of less than 100 instead has a chance to activate these effects. Not compatible with other bear species upgrades.
- Roar (4 SP): The bear gains a roar with a cooldown of 3 turns that stuns enemies in a 7 range cone for 3 turns. The venom bear's roar will also poison enemies for 5 turns and give regeneration to allies for the same duration. The blood bear's roar will instead berserk enemies and give allies a stack of bloodrage for 10 turns.

- Holy Martyr (6 SP): Dark damage dealt by Pain Mirror that is resisted or blocked by SH will be redealt as holy damage.

Seal Fate:

- Now has a chance to refund a charge on cast, equal to half the number of shards that miss divided by the total number of shards.

If it's smart enough to seek enemies, it should be smart enough to not hit allies. Not compatible with the new Particle Surge upgrade below.

- Now instead inflicts a Fragility debuff equal to the duration of the freeze inflicted, which persists after unfreezing. If freeze duration is refreshed or extended, fragility duration will be adjusted to match if shorter.

Glittering Dance:
- Now has the nature tag.

Hypocrisy:
- Now also works on spells of equal level, but you cannot gain the Hypocrisy buff with a spell that benefitted from Hypocrisy.

Purestrike:
- As per my No More Scams mod, no longer harms allies, and is based on damage pre-resistances.
- Now has a grace period of 1 turn where a unit can be unshielded but still benefit. The grace period is fixed.
- Cost increased to 6 SP.

Storm Caller:
- Thunderstorm clouds now benefit doubly from damage bonuses.

Bone Guard:
- Now also summons a bone archer, and all summoned units have +1 reincarnation.

Frostbite:
- Now instead inflicts a Frostbite debuff equal to the duration of the freeze inflicted, which persists after unfreezing. If freeze duration is refreshed or extended, frostbite duration will be adjusted to match if shorter.
- SP cost reduced to 5.

Inferno Engines:
- Level increased to 7, but the effect is now fully retroactive, automatically applying to all newly summoned metallic minions and minions that become metallic.

Lightning Warp:
- Now inflicts a Warp Lightning debuff on affected enemies, then deals damage to all enemies with Warp Lightning. This means that if Lightning Warp is triggered more than once in a turn, the initially affected enemies will be damaged every time the skill triggers, no matter where they're teleported to.
- Teleport range now scales with range bonuses.
- Damage now occurs even if the target is not teleported.
