This mod makes changes to a number of spells and skills that I believe to be underwhelming or not interesting enough compared to other options. A secondary goal is to add new upgrades to certain spells that are severely lacking in meaningful, interesting upgrades.

Changelog:

Death Bolt:
- Damage upgrade cost reduced to 1 SP. This should make it more attractive as a quick power boost in early game, and useful for Cantrip Cascade builds.
- Withering upgrade now makes it also deal physical damage to non-living targets, but SP cost increased to 5.

Fireball:
- Damage type upgrades changed to redeal all fire damage resisted or blocked by SH as a split between the other damage types.

Poison Sting:
- Torment (5 SP): Deal 1 extra damage per 10 turns of poison on the target, and 1 extra damage per turn of every other debuff on the target. Deal 1 extra damage per debuff on the target. Multiple stacks of the same type of debuff are counted as different debuffs.

Wolf:
- Ice hounds are now nature units.
- Wolf Pack cost reduced to 7, because I don't think anything should cost more than 7 SP; 7 SP should be enough for this upgrade anyways. It also counts as casting the spell twice, to make you not lose out on Thorn Garden and Icy Spriggan shrine procs. Number of wolves summoned now benefits from num summons bonuses.

Annihilate:
- Max charges upgrade now costs 6 SP and gives +16 charges.
- Arcane Annihilation and Dark Annihilation merged into one upgrade that costs 2 SP, so you can save SP at a circle.
- Disintegrate (7 SP): Annihilate will now deal all of its damage in separate 1 damage hits, cycling through all of its damage types repeatedly. Each hit removes SH separately, and cannot be resisted unless the target is immune to that damage type.

Blazerip:
- Fractal Rip (6 SP): Each hit of Blazerip now has a 10% chance of triggering another Blazerip on that tile. This can still happen even if an empty tile is hit. Each rip can trigger at most one additional rip.

Boiling Blood:
- Retroactive (4 SP): You now gain Bloodlust Aura when you cast this spell, during which all minions you summon will automatically gain Boiling Blood for the remaining duration.

Disperse:
- Quantum Shadow (6 SP): Summon a void ghost in the former location of each unit teleported away. These void ghosts cannot be affected by this spell.

Eye of Fire:
- Eye of Blasting (3 SP): On hit, Eye of Fire also deals damage to all enemies adjacent to the target.

Eye of Ice:
- Eye of Freezing (3 SP): On hit, the target is frozen for 1 turn.

Eye of Lightning:
- Eye of Arcing (3 SP): On hit, Eye of Lightning also deals damage to a random enemy in line of sight of the target.

Eye of Rage:
- Lycanthropy upgrade replaced by Curse of Rage (5 SP): When an already berserk enemy is targeted by Eye of Rage, it now chooses a random valid target for one of its abilities. If the new target is another enemy, the first enemy is forced to use that ability on the new target. Otherwise the first enemy is stunned for 1 turn.

Fan of Flames:
- Previously, if you're somehow moved into the target square while channeling, you'll hit all tiles in range except yourself. Now, if this happens, you'll only hit all tiles in a radius of 5 plus bonuses, but there's now a Wheel of Flames upgrade (4 SP) that lets you simply target yourself with the spell to reproduce the effect.

Freeze:
- Absolute Zero (6 SP): The target now permanently loses 100 ice resistance before being frozen.
- Permafrost (5 SP): When targeting an already frozen unit, increase the duration of freeze on it by one third of this spell's duration if the result is greater than this spell's duration. Then deal ice damage equal to twice the target's freeze duration.

Healing Light:
- Cleansing Light (3 SP): Healing Light will now remove all debuffs from affected allies before healing them.
- Now considers berserked allies as friendly, due to the above.

Heavenly Blast:
- Spirit Bind cost reduced to 4 SP, and now inflicts a Spirit Binding debuff that raises the target as a spirit on death, which is removed at the beginning of your next turn.

Hollow Flesh:
- As per my No More Scams mod, no longer limited to living units.
- Mockery of Life (2 SP): Affected units no longer gain dark resistance.
- Vigor Mortis (4 SP): When your minions are affected, their max HP are instead buffed by the same percentage. They do not gain heal immunity, and instead gain 100 poison resistance. If you have the Fire Vulnerability upgrade, they instead gain 50 ice resistance. If you have the Mockery of Life upgrade, they still gain dark resistance and do not lose holy resistance.

Hungry Maw:
- Range upgrade folded into base spell (from 7 to 11).
- Maw now has a melee bite attack that deals 3x damage.
- Pull Strength (3 SP): +2 tiles pulled.
- Shield Eater (3 SP): The maw gains 1 SH on kill and when attacking a shielded target, up to its original SH amount.

Invoke Savagery:
- As per my No More Scams mod, no longer tries to attack physical-immune targets unless the minion doing the attack has physical redeals.
- Blood Savagery (3 SP): Now also affects nature and demon units.
- Stampede (5 SP): If no melee targets are available, each ally will instead try to perform a charge attack with a range of 6 tiles. This attack does not stun.

Magnetize:
- Base radius and radius upgrade increased by 1 each.
- Pull strength and duration upgrades reduced to 2 SP.
- Universal Magnetism upgrade reduced to 3 SP.

Melt:
- As per my No More Scams mod, debuffs are now permanent.
- Now also an enchantment spell.
- Since the Absolute Zero upgrade for Freeze now exists, the ice resistance reduction upgrade is changed to fire resistance reduction instead, and increases cost to 4 SP.
- Can now target empty tiles, and now reduces resistances before dealing damage.

Petrify:
- Max charges increased to 20. Max charges upgrade changed to +10 charges for 2 SP.
- Stone Curse (6 SP): Whenever an enemy is inflicted with petrify or glassify, permanently inflict Stone Curse to it, which reduces holy, dark, arcane, and poison resistances by 50 as long as the target is petrified or glassified. This consumes a charge of Petrify and counts as casting Petrify on that enemy; it will not be triggered if Petrify has no more charges remaining.

Soul Swap:
- Shadow Swap (2 SP): Soul Swap can target dark units as well.
- Infernal Swap (3 SP): Soul Swap can target demon units as well.

Touch of Death:
- All the damage type upgrades now do the same amount of damage as dark damage done, but are increased to 2 SP. Now also has a lightning damage upgrade.
- Damage (4 SP): +200 damage.
- Touch of the Raven and Touch of the Vampire removed. Touch of the Reaper now has the reapers use your Touch of Death as well, and it's no longer limited to living units.
- Fear of Death (5 SP): If Touch of Death kills its target, all enemies in line of sight of the target are inflicted with a stack of the fear of death for 6 turns. Each turn, each stack of fear has a chance to stun its victim for 1 turn, equal to 100% divided by the distance between the victim and the source of its fear, if the source is visible to the victim. A stack of fear is automatically removed if its source is no longer alive.

Toxic Spores:
- Grey Mushbooms upgrade replaced by Toxic Mushbooms (4 SP), which is mutually exclusive with other mushboom type upgrades and gives 3-radiu 1-damage poison auras to mushbooms; the aura instantly activates 3 times on death. Stunning is redundant with Paralyzing Venom anyways, not to mention losing poison synergy.

Aether Swap:
- Restriction of not working on arcane-immune targets removed.
- If targeting an ally, give the target 1 SH instead of dealing damage.
- Patsy Swap (5 SP): You can now target yourself with this spell to give yourself a stack of Swapper's Scheme, which consumes another charge of the spell and counts as casting the spell twice. Whenever you are about to take damage, you automatically consume a stack of Swapper's Scheme to swap with a random valid enemy target of this spell. You gain 1 SH, which ignores the normal 20 SH limit, while the target takes damage from both Aether Swap and the damage that you took.
- Glitch Swap (5 SP): You can now target an empty tile with this spell to swap with a unit that does not exist, which consumes another charge of the spell and counts as casting the spell twice. This summons a glitch phantom at your old location, which is an arcane minion with 1 SH and the same max HP as you that can cast Aether Swap with the same upgrades, skills, and shrine as your own. The glitch phantom has a fixed lifetime of 1 turn.

Basilisk Armor:
- Max Charges upgrade removed.
- Petrify Duration (2 SP): +3 petrify duration.
- Thorns (4 SP): Enemies targeting you with spells also take 16 poison damage. If you have the Stunning Armor upgrade, also deal lightning damage. If you have the Freezing Armor upgrade, also deal ice damage. If you have the Glassifying Armor upgrade, also deal physical damage.
- Stunning Armor (2 SP): Basilisk Armor inflicts stun instead of petrify. Only one armor upgrade allowed.
- Freezing Armor (2 SP): Basilisk Armor inflicts freeze instead of petrify. Only one armor upgrade allowed.
- Glassifying Armor (2 SP): Basilisk Armor inflicts glassify instead of petrify. Only one armor upgrade allowed.

Blinding Light:
- Dark Units upgrade was superfluous and thus folded into the base spell.
- Safety (3 SP): No longer affects friendly units.

Blink:
- The damage upgrades now deal damage equal to the spell's range, and the bursts can pass through walls if the spell has blindcasting.

Choir of Angels:
- For consistency with other aura-type effects, the angels' song are no longer affected by damage bonuses, instead dealing fixed 2 fire and 2 holy damage. To compensate, they no longer damage allies or heal enemies.
- The angels' default resistances changed to 100% fire, 100% holy, and 0% dark.
- Fallen Choir (7 SP): The angels become demon units and gain 100 dark resistance. They gain a wailing attack with a cooldown of 7 turns that deals 7 dark damage to enemies in the same radius as their song, and an attack with 4 range that deals 4 fire damage. Unlike their song, these attacks benefit from bonuses to minion damage.

Darkness:
- Max Charges upgrade removed.
- Dark Horizon (3 SP): Hostile demon and undead units also have a chance to be blinded each turn. The chance for this skill to fail is equal to 100% divided by half the distance between you and each enemy, up to 100%.
- Clinging Darkness (4 SP): When affecting an enemy, this spell now inflicts blind for 2 turns, which stacks in duration with pre-existing blind it has.
- Dark Echoes (6 SP): While Darkness is active and you are blind, whenever your demon and undead minions deal damage to an enemy, the target loses current HP equal to half of the damage dealt.

Devour Mind:
- All of the HP threshold effects are now calculated after redeals, to make the spell more forgiving.
- Now also works on nature units by default.
- Spirit Eater upgrade now also lets it work on holy and undead units.
- Mind Gouge (3 SP): If the target is over 50% HP after taking arcane damage, instead deal half dark damage to it.
- Mindless Eater (3 SP): Can now target all units. When targeting a unit outside of this spell's previously valid target groups, only the initial arcane damage is dealt.
- Mind Rot (4 SP): If the target takes arcane damage from this spell and dies, summon a void imp and an insanity imp near it. If the target takes dark damage from this spell and dies, summon a rot imp near it.

Dominate:
- HP threshold is now based on the damage stat, and the HP threshold upgrade is changed to a damage upgrade.
- Dominating an enemy now procs on-summon effects, and it now counts as a minion summoned by Dominate.
- Can now be used to remove berserk from allies.
- Mass Dominate (6 SP): When cast, Dominate now also affects all eligible units with the same name as the target within 3 tiles.
- Recruitment Bonus (3 SP): The target enemy is now healed to full HP after being dominated, and all of its debuffs are dispelled.

Earthquake:
- Added a 3 SP +25% strikechance upgrade.

Flame Burst:
- Bright Flame upgrade replaced by Phoenix Flame, which costs 4 SP and heals allies (except the wizard) instead of damaging them, and does not change the damage type. This makes it a natural extension of the base spell while providing additional healing with Pyrophilia, instead of changing the damage type to holy and losing out on all fire synergies.
- Spreading Flame now counts as casting the spell once per charge consumed.

Frostfire Hydra:
- Beams now benefit from both minion damage and breath damage bonuses.
- Is now a permanent minion; minion duration upgrade removed.
- Dragon Mage (6 SP): The hydra will cast Melt on the target of its fire beam, and Freeze on the target of its ice beam. These spells gains all of your upgrades and bonuses.
- Splitting (4 SP): Upon reaching 0 HP, the hydra splits into a frost hydra and a fire hydra. Each hydra inherits one of the frostfire hydra's beams and resistances.

Giant Bear:
- Max Charges upgrade removed and its benefits folded into the base spell.
- Armored Bear upgrade removed.
- Polar Bear (5 SP): Summons a polar bear instead of a giant bear. Polar bears are resistant to ice damage, can freeze units around itself, and gains regeneration and an ice aura while frozen. For every 100 ice resistance the polar bear has above 100, the self-healing and ice aura activate once per turn. An excess of less than 100 instead has a chance to activate these effects. Not compatible with other bear species upgrades.
- Roar (4 SP): The bear gains a roar with a cooldown of 3 turns that stuns enemies in a 7 range cone for 3 turns. The venom bear's roar will also poison enemies for 5 turns and give regeneration to allies for the same duration. The blood bear's roar will instead berserk enemies for 3 turns and give allies a stack of bloodrage for 10 turns.

Ironize:
- No longer a conjuration spell.

Mercurize:
- Mercurial Vengeance no longer affects allies.
- Noxious Fumes now gains bonus radius equal to the square root of 10% of the geist's initial max HP, rounded up.
- Corrosion upgrade replaced with Recursive Mercurize (2 SP): Mercurize now lasts indefinitely and is considered a buff if applied to a Quicksilver Geist, instead healing it each turn by an amount equal to this spell's damage stat. This still allows the geist to spawn another geist on death.

Mystic Vision:
- Vision Aura upgrade cost increased to 7 SP, but is now retroactive, automatically applying to all newly summoned minions.

Nightmare Aura:
- The dream upgrades are changed to only summon old witches, aelves, and flame rifts. Each dream upgrade summons a minion for every 25 damage dealt, which should result in roughly the same amount as before.
- Dormancy (3 SP): If there are no enemies left in a realm, Nightmare Aura will not decrease in remaining duration. This allows an instance of the buff to persist from one realm to the next.

Pain Mirror:
- Max Charges upgrade removed.
- False Pain (6 SP): Pain Mirror now counts incoming damage twice. The first time counts the raw incoming damage before resistances and SH, and the second time counts actual damage taken. The first count will trigger even if all of the incoming damage is resisted or blocked.
- Masochism (3 SP): Damage inflicted by allies will cause Pain Mirror to deal double damage.
- Holy Martyr (6 SP): Dark damage dealt by Pain Mirror that is resisted or blocked by SH will be redealt as holy damage.

Seal Fate:
- The curse now uses a timer that ticks down as a per-turn effect instead of remaining duration, to interact better with reworked Permanence and Time Dilation from my Missing Synergies mod.
- Spreading Curse upgrade cost increased to 4 SP, but now if a cursed enemy dies to anything else, the curse jumps to a new enemy with its remaining duration.

Shrapnel Blast:
- The initial fire explosion is removed, because it's superfluous and not relevant in most uses.
- The Puncturing Shards upgrade, which actually lets the shards pass through walls, is rolled into the base spell.
- Now has a chance to refund a charge on cast, equal to half the number of shards that miss divided by the total number of shards.
- The Magnetized Shards upgrade now makes it so that if there are no enemies in the area, no more shards will be fired; shards not fired do not count as shards missed. If it's smart enough to seek enemies, it should be smart enough to not hit allies. Not compatible with the new Particle Surge upgrade below.
- Particle Surge (7 SP): Shrapnel Blast becomes a channeled spell, and no longer destroys the target wall. Each shard now deals damage in a beam between the target tile and its destination. Not compatible with Magnetized Shards.

Blizzard:
- Hailstorm (6 SP): If an affected tile already has a blizzard cloud, the unit on that tile is dealt ice damage equal to twice the damage of this spell, and frozen for 1 turn.

Bone Barrage:
- Now no longer requires line of sight.
- All original upgrades except Shambler Assembly removed. This spell is meant to give a strong single-target option to most conjuration builds, so its upgrades should support that niche instead of pull the spell toward conflicting directions in ways where the barrier to entry isn't worth the payoff.
- Range (3 SP): +50 range.
- Bone Regrowth (5 SP): Each ally damaged by Bone Barrage gains regeneration for 4 turns, each turn recovering HP equal to 25% of the HP lost.
- Ghost Bones (5 SP): Each ally also deals 4 dark damage to the target, regardless of the amount of damage the ally took; this damage benefits from bonuses to damage. Allies not in line of sight of the target will now also deal this additional dark damage to the target.
- Shambler Assembly now gives the shambler regen equal to 1/8 of its initial max HP if you have Bone Regrowth, and its attack deals additional dark damage equal to your number of minions at the time of casting plus minion damage bonus if you have Ghost Bones.

Chimera Familiar:
- Overhauled. Instead of copying spells when you cast them, the chimera now automatically copies an eligible spell every turn with its action, choosing the spell with the highest max charges and draining a charge of that spell. This counts as you casting the spell.
- Max Charges upgrade removed and folded into the base spell.
- The chimera's base HP is increased to 26, the same as those of enemy chaos chimeras. Its default attacks have 5 damage and 5 range.
- The chimera now starts with 75% fire and lightning resistance, and the Minion Resists upgrade is replaced by a 3 SP upgrade that gives +25% fire, +25% lightning, and +100% physical resistances (fire lion and lightning snake get +50% of the resistance they don't have instead of +25% to both).

- Wild Metamorphosis (1 SP): Chimera Familiar randomly gains 7 minion health, 3 minion damage, or 1 minion range. This upgrade can be purchased an unlimited number of times.

Conductance:
- Instead of copying lightning spells cast at the target, the debuff will have a 50% chance to cause any lightning damage dealt to the target, before resistances, to also be redealt to a target in line of sight up to 4 tiles away, and apply Conductance with duration equal to the current remaining duration to it after dealing damage.
- Multicopy and max charges upgrades removed.
- Cascade Range (4 SP): + 4 cascade range.
- Duration (3 SP): +10 duration.

Essence Flux:
- Level reduced to 3.
- Blindcasting (2 SP): Essence Flux no longer requires line of sight to cast.
- Imbalanced Flux (5 SP): For each pair of resistances, both resistances will be set to the lower of the two if the affected unit is an enemy, and the higher of the two if the affected unit is an ally.

Fiery Tormentor:
- Tormentor's Remorse (4 SP): The range of the tormentor's soul suck is increased by its the radius of its torment. Its soul suck now also heals the wizard, but the total amount healed cannot exceed the total damage that the wizard has taken from tormentors summoned by this spell, before counting heal resistance.

Ice Drake:
- Dragon Mage changed to cast your Icicle every 3 turns.

Lightning Form:
- Is now also a translocation spell.

- Ice Infusion (4 SP): Now also gives 100 ice resistance and functions with ice spells.

Lightning Storm:
- Strike Twice (5 SP): If an affected tile already has a thunderstorm cloud, the unit on that tile is dealt lightning damage equal to the damage of this spell. If you have the Strikechance upgrade, there is a 50% chance to deal damage again.

Orb Control:
- Max Charges (4 SP): +9 max charges.
- Range (2 SP): +5 range.
- Anti-Particle Beam (5 SP): When casting this spell, every allied orb will shoot a beam at the target tile. Each beam deals damage of each damage type the orb is not immune to, multiplied by 100% minus the orb's resistance to that damage type. The base damage is equal to 4 times the orb's level, and does not harm allies. A beam melts through walls if its corresponding orb can melt through walls; otherwise it is stopped by the first wall it encounters.

Permanence:
- Retroactive (3 SP): When you cast this spell, all friendly units' buffs and enemies' debuffs are extended by 5 turns. Cannot extend the duration of stun, freeze, petrify, glassify, and similar incapacitating effects on units that can gain clarity.

Siege Golems:
- Cannons now benefit from minion health bonuses. Golems' repair ability changed to heal for the cannon's max HP divided by 9, rounded up, which makes it unchanged without any minion health bonuses.

- Wall Demolition (4 SP): Each inferno cannon's attack and self-destruct will now destroy walls.
- Phase Operator (2 SP): Siege golems gain the ability to teleport next to nearby inferno cannons.

Sight of Blood:
- Completely overhauled, because the original is thematically redundant with Eye of Rage while being too situational. Is now also an eye and conjuration spell.

- Unending Bloodrage (5 SP): When the target dies, the curse is applied to another random enemy in line of sight for its remaining duration.

Siphon Shields:
- Shield Burn upgrade cost increased to 4 SP, but it now makes a separate hit for each SH siphoned, meaning it can remove up to twice the SH. Damage of each hit also benefits from damage bonuses.
- Shield Mirage (4 SP): If you already have 20 SH, then every additional 3 SH stolen will summon a shield mirage near you. Shield mirages are stationary, flying arcane minions with fixed 1 HP, 3 SH:shields, and no resistances.

Units in the affected area take 22 ice damage and are frozen for 3 turns. If a unit is killed then an ice elemental is summoned in its tile.

Watcher Form:
- Now also an eye spell.
- The resist buffs are rolled into the beam-shooting buff, so you can't get the resists separately via Purity anymore.
- Void Watcher (6 SP): Watcher Form also grants 100 arcane resist. Watcher Form now instead targets the furthest unit from the caster regardless of line of sight, melts through walls, and also deals arcane damage.
- Watcher's Instinct (6 SP): While in Watcher Form, each turn you will automatically cast a random one of your lightning or arcane sorcery spells at a random valid enemy target, consuming charges as usual.

Wheel of Death:

Fae Court:

Floating Eye:

- Eternal Gaze (2 SP): When the floating eye loses an [eye] buff, that buff will be reapplied with unlimited duration.
